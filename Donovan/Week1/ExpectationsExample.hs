  putStrLn "\nConclusion:"
  putStrLn "If we combine properties (1, 3, 4) there are no counterexamples that can refute the validity (only 3 and 4 doesn't work for zero). Property 4 could potentially be split into two 'isLinear' and 'firstDeltaIsInput' properties (such that they are more atomic), that cover a subset of the cases. Property 2 is redundant over the combination of property 3 and 4. Although, all properties are still valid to get a more fine-grained view on the validity of the function under test."
