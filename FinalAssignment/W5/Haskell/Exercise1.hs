-- SSVT Haskell Lab
-- Week 5 - Group 5
-- Exercise 1: We provide some mutators to mutate the output of the list in Mutation.hs. Write down which types of output are not yet covered by these mutators, 
-- and about their weakness/strength. Come up with a list of other mutators and implement (a subset of) them.
-- Deliverables: List of mutators and rationale, implementation, indication of time spent.
-- Time spend: ~ hours --
