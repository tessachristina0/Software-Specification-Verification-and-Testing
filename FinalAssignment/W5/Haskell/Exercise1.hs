-- Exercise 1: We provide some mutators to mutate the output of the list in Mutation.hs. Write down which types of output are not yet covered by these mutators, 
-- and about their weakness/strength. Come up with a list of other mutators and implement (a subset of) them.

List of mutators and rationale:
The mutation functions which are applied in Mutation.hs are: 
  - addElements 
  - removeElements

Not covered per mutator:
  addElements:
    - Random additions in the list before the existing array. Now there is always one new integer in front of the existing array.
    - List given in order. The list isn't ordered now, it is completely random.
  removeElements:
    - Not covered: Random deletion, it always removes from right to left in a list
    - Not covered: The first item is never removed from the list

Both mutators are weak since they are not covering a lot of constraints.

List of other possible mutators (there can be more):
  - Arithmetic: Add/Substract/Multiply/Divide/Modulo
  - Array Declarationâ€‹: Empty a list ([1,2,3,4] -> [])
  - Boolean Literal: Change the value of the boolean
  - Equality Operator: Change the equality operator in a function
  - Logical Operator: Change the logical operator in a function to a different logical operator
